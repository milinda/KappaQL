# KappaQL

**KappaQL** is a SQL like Clojure DSL implementing
[Kappa](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/07/questioning-the-lambda-architecture.html)
[Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0) proposed
originally by LinkedIn engineers [Jay
Kreps](https://twitter.com/jaykreps) and [Martin
Kleppmann](http://martin.kleppmann.com).

## What Is Kappa Architecture?


## Design and Implementation


### User Interaction (1st Prototype as of 10/02/2014)

1.  User starts the repl using `lein repl` from the KappaQL project base
    directory.
2.  Bootstrap the environment with information about Samza cluster(YARN,
Kafka and Zookeeper) and view storage(Cassandra/Redis).

    > Bootstrap will spawn a web server which expose views generated by
    > KappaQL.This web app will directly talk to view storage and
    > retrieve views.

3.  Write queries and submit them.
4.  Browse to KappaQL Views web app and view the output real-time.

### What Happens When User Runs A Query

*During the bootstrap process, project will get build, packed and uploaded to YARN. This makes sure we have all the required artifacts when original query is submitted.*

1.  Query compiler read cluster meta-data and generate execution plan.
2.  Then using Samza job submission tool we submit the real job to YARN.


### Implementation Plan

1.  Implement the first part of the bootstrap process where it builds the Samza cluster configuration.
2.  Design basic query DSL and execution.
3.  KappaQL Views web application.
